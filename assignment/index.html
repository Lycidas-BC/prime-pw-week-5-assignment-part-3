    <p>See console for output.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>When I try to use template literals (`${}`) to test my function, the console log prints "[object Object]" instead of actually printing the object itself (see line 30 in music-collection.js). When I don't use template literals, the object prints properly (see line 31 in music-collection.js). Is there a way that I can use template literals and still have the printed object display its contents?</li>
    </ul>
